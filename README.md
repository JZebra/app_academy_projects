###Welcome

This repository holds all of the projects that I worked on in App academy. Not included are smaller exercises that teach new concepts. The projects are all in varying degrees of completeness.


####Completeness

- Complete: the code does what it's supposed to do. Functionality is complete or near complete (eg. Chess. The pieces can move and capture but castling and en passant capture have not been implemented). The visuals or console interface, while not polished, allow interaction with the game/app.

- Rough: One step below complete. The project requires some more work until reaching full functionality.

- Incomplete: A rough patchwork of code. The design is there but the project is at less than 70% functionality.
